# CellularAutomata
This is a rule based system I build similair to the game of life.
Instead of 2 dimensions this only keeps evolving from a 1Dimensional list.
By constantly displaying a new generation on top each other, you will get a visually appealing imagery.

To test this you need python 3 installed and import the tkinter package to make it work.
You can mess around with the rules and run the '__main__.py' script.

Results may vary but here are some interesting results with rules i came up with.
